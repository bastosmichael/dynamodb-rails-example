Simple Survey Application built on DynamoDB

	submission for "Awesome Demo with Amazon DynamoDB"


== Live Demo App

== How to Run Rails demo app
  - configure AWS access_key_id and secret_access_key in config/aws.yml
  $ bundle install
  $ rails s


== Dynamo Tables Design

- User table: hash key is name(string type)
   This table has all users data. Currently there is only one attribute 'sex', but any attribute
   can be added for customized survey

- Survey table: hash key is title(string type)
   The Survey table has information about all surveys

- Result: hash key is surveytitle (string type), range key is username(string type)
   This table has the actual replies from users. One good thing of hask/range key table is it can
   query all data for a particular survey only with hask_key. So I set survey title to hash key,
   user name to range key.


== Ruby Model Class

  I created a model class for each table, and made the API similar to ActiveRecord.
  Here are some examples.

  - User.all
  - User.find('john')
  - user = User.new(:name => 'Tibo', :sex => 'male')
  - user.save
  - Result.query(:hash_value => 'primary')

Thank you very much
